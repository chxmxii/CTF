They are given a static website
Inside there is an s3 bucket
Inside they will find a deleted terraform plan
In order to view it they will need terraform of course
Then inside the plan it will reveal resources/ips
One of the ip is a rev proxy on ec2 metadata
From there they will find creds for a role
The role will be able to list lambda functions
I'm thinking of os command injection from there a new creds they will find
Its also a role
The second role can access databases since the lambda function created is to access databases 
So make sense 
It will be RDS 
Inside there will be creds for either Jenkins server or teamcity
If Jenkins I'm thinking of storing creds and they have to use Jenkins console to crack the password
After that they will get new creds for an aws user
The user is able to ssh into an ec2 instance
That instance will have gitlab running locally
In order to access it they need to do port forwarding
Then after accessing the gitlab server they will do a CI/CD pipeline injection into that runner
The runner will be a k8s pod
That will will have broken RBAC
Let them be able to create malicious pods

Then a rotten pod will ve able to access the host file system
Where they will find the flag
Sounds easy I know
Now I need your help regarding the self hosted gitlab
I won't lie i tried before
The gitlab itself was successful
But my issue was with the runner
I was not able to make work
I'm doing it via docker
The self hosting process
